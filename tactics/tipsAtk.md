# Tips for Attackers

- Learn the rooms and how many Exolizers spawn in each one, so you know when it's fully purged and you can move to the next.
- Trust your Defenders, and try not to back-track to aid in defending Exolizers unless absolutely necessary.
- Be quick about leaving Room C back to Room A, as the long run back to the start of the Exolizer Rotation can often be where things spiral out of control if 3 or 4 possessed Exolizers are waiting for you through corridors packed with enemies. The meter fills fast.
- Use the green extraction icon to guide you back to Room A from Room C.
- You might reach the next attack room early and be chilling while no enemies are present and you're waiting for an Exolizer to spawn. This is fine.
- Pay attention to Exolizers above all else. If there are currently 4 possessed Exolizers, stop what you're doing immediately to purge.
- Void tears can be cleared by Void Slinging through them, or casting Madurai's Contamination Wave on them. These can be done while in Void Mode, and are safer alternatives to shooting them with your Amp.
- If your role is Dedicated, leave a fully purged room ASAP. There might be absolute chaos behind you with diamonds flashing red and teammates going down, but you're doing the right thing by leaving.
- For a scenario example, if you've purged 1B and 2B, but 1B starts getting attacked while you're in the middle of purging 3B, prioritise purging 3B and leave 1B to be re-possessed. It's likely your Defenders are on the way and they will re-purge it, plus it's more important for all Exolizers in a room to finish as closely together as possible to allow Defenders to move on as quickly as possible. If you purge 1B and 2B, then get distracted and take over a minute to purge 3B, 3B is now over a minute behind 1B and 2B, so a Defender is forced to stay behind for longer. If 1B is captured while you're purging 3B, it simply means 3B and 1B will complete closer together.
- If an Acolyte spawns on you, try to ignore it until you've purged Exolizers first. You may have to make an exception for Violence.
