Enemies are harassing you and you&#39;re constantly on the move. The Exolizer spawns are relentless. Some Warframe&#39;s kits are better at handling the mission objective than others, as they can cover all necessary requirements and are easier for you, the player, to play.</p><div style align="center"> The three things you want to consider are listed below </div><h2 id="accessibility" tabindex="-1"><strong>Accessibility</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#accessibility" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Accessibility**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In a broad sense this means how straightforward and easy a Warframe is to play, and in what ways they meet the mission requirements. This is very subjective between players, but as organised Cascade runs can be multiple hours long, players should make their own choices on what they find comfortable playing.</p><h2 id="survivability" tabindex="-1"><strong>Survivability</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#survivability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Survivability**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Though this is linked to accessibility, it&#39;s also subjective when considering different players&#39; preferred playstyles. Beyond 65 Exolizers, your options for survival are typically stealth, damage prevention, or active shield gating, supported by crowd control.</p><h2 id="damage-output" tabindex="-1"><strong>Damage Output</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#damage-output" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Damage Output**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Some Warframes bring scaling and/or true damage abilities, which makes killing Thrax and/or trash much easier. No maintaining Galvanized stacks, no worrying about headshots, just point and click.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">IMPORTANT:</p><p>You can, and should, play whatever you want in Cascade, as it&#39;s a fun testing ground for builds and loadouts.
