This also remains an accessible option for newer players, due to the time-gated access of other Incarnon Genesis weapons in the Duviri Circuit.</p><ul><li><strong>Dual Toxocyst</strong></li></ul><p>Dual Toxocyst has a great damage output, both for single target and trash clearing. It works well modded for Corrosive alongside two Corrosive Emerald Shards for armour strip, and is often paired with a Nourish subsume for Viral. Scourge is often used with it for easier headshots.</p><ul><li><strong>Furis</strong></li></ul><p>Furis likewise has a great damage output, and very quickly stacks an immense amount of Heat DoTs. Roar is a good subsume for double dipping these DoTs. Scourge can help with easier headshots.</p><ul><li><strong>12x Combo Melee Heavy Attacks (Normal or Slam)</strong></li></ul><p>Melee Crescendo and/or Tennokai make this method much easier to use and maintain than in the past. Wrathful Advance as a subsume can help, but is not required. Finishers for Crescendo can be easily stacked through Aero mods, Dizzying Rounds on Bronco, and Mercy kills on Eximus and heavy units.</p><ul><li><strong>Exodia Contagion Zaws</strong></li></ul><p>Contagion Zaws typically rely on stacking many conditional buffs that have a multiplicative effect, such as Vigorous Swap, Arcane Arachne, and Condition Overload, but a Wrathful Advance subsume can make them more accessible with greater flexibility.</p></div><h2 id="thrax-spectral-form" tabindex="-1"><strong>Thrax Spectral Form</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#thrax-spectral-form" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Thrax Spectral Form**&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Eternal Eradicate and Eternal Onslaught will give you the best damage output on your Amp.</li><li>Headshots and guaranteed crits from Onslaught will make an enormous difference in your damage and TTK.</li><li><strong>With Madurai:</strong> while the Thrax performs its Spectral animation, do a Void Sling, then cast Contamination Wave three times. This primes the Thrax to take more Void damage, procs Eradicate, and depletes your energy enough to proc Onslaught.</li><li><strong>With Madurai:</strong> Void Strike has a long cooldown, and you will often be expected to deal with Spectrals when it&#39;s not available. Get used to the Contamination Wave method above as your bread and butter, and only use Void Strike as and when needed.</li><li><strong>&quot;Parked&quot; Warframes:</strong> All channelled abilities and some duration abilities leave the Warframe vulnerable to 10% of incoming damage while parked.
