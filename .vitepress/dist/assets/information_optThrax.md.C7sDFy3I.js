This also remains an accessible option for newer players, due to the time-gated access of other Incarnon Genesis weapons in the Duviri Circuit.</p><h2 id="dual-toxocyst" tabindex="-1"><strong>Dual Toxocyst</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#dual-toxocyst" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Dual Toxocyst**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Dual Toxocyst has a great damage output, both for single target and trash clearing. It works well modded for Corrosive alongside two Corrosive Emerald Shards for armour strip, and is often paired with a Nourish subsume for Viral. Scourge is often used with it for easier headshots.</p><h2 id="furis" tabindex="-1"><strong>Furis</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#furis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Furis**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Furis likewise has a great damage output, and very quickly stacks an immense amount of Heat DoTs. Roar is a good subsume for double dipping these DoTs. Scourge can help with easier headshots.</p><h2 id="_12x-combo-melee-heavy-attacks-normal-or-slam" tabindex="-1"><strong>12x Combo Melee Heavy Attacks (Normal or Slam)</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_12x-combo-melee-heavy-attacks-normal-or-slam" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**12x Combo Melee Heavy Attacks (Normal or Slam)**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Melee Crescendo and/or Tennokai make this method much easier to use and maintain than in the past. Wrathful Advance as a subsume can help, but is not required. Finishers for Crescendo can be easily stacked through Aero mods, Dizzying Rounds on Bronco, and Mercy kills on Eximus and heavy units.</p><h2 id="exodia-contagion-zaws" tabindex="-1"><strong>Exodia Contagion Zaws</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#exodia-contagion-zaws" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Exodia Contagion Zaws**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Contagion Zaws typically rely on stacking many conditional buffs that have a multiplicative effect, such as Vigorous Swap, Arcane Arachne, and Condition Overload, but a Wrathful Advance subsume can make them more accessible with greater flexibility.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title"><strong>Thrax Spectral Form</strong></p><ul><li>Eternal Eradicate and Eternal Onslaught will give you the best damage output on your Amp.</li><li>Headshots and guaranteed crits from Onslaught will make an enormous difference in your damage and TTK.</li><li><strong>With Madurai:</strong> while the Thrax performs its Spectral animation, do a Void Sling, then cast Contamination Wave three times.
