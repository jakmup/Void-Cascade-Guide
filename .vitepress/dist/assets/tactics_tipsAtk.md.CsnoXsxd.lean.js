The meter fills fast.</li><li>Use the green extraction icon to guide you back to Room A from Room C.</li><li>You might reach the next attack room early and be chilling while no enemies are present and you&#39;re waiting for an Exolizer to spawn. This is fine.</li><li>Pay attention to Exolizers above all else. If there are currently 4 possessed Exolizers, stop what you&#39;re doing immediately to purge.</li><li>Void tears can be cleared by Void Slinging through them, or casting Madurai&#39;s Contamination Wave on them. These can be done while in Void Mode, and are safer alternatives to shooting them with your Amp.</li><li>If your role is Dedicated, leave a fully purged room ASAP. There might be absolute chaos behind you with diamonds flashing red and teammates going down, but you&#39;re doing the right thing by leaving.</li><li>For a scenario example, if you&#39;ve purged 1B and 2B, but 1B starts getting attacked while you&#39;re in the middle of purging 3B, prioritise purging 3B and leave 1B to be re-possessed. It&#39;s likely your Defenders are on the way and they will re-purge it, plus it&#39;s more important for all Exolizers in a room to finish as closely together as possible to allow Defenders to move on as quickly as possible. If you purge 1B and 2B, then get distracted and take over a minute to purge 3B, 3B is now over a minute behind 1B and 2B, so a Defender is forced to stay behind for longer. If 1B is captured while you&#39;re purging 3B, it simply means 3B and 1B will complete closer together.</li><li>If an Acolyte spawns on you, try to ignore it until you&#39;ve purged Exolizers first. You may have to make an exception for Violence.</li></ul>',2)]))}const m=t(r,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
