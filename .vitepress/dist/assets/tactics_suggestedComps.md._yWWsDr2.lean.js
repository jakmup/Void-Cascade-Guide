Since they know the Dedicated Attacker is focused on killing Thrax, they can focus on trash killing to keep enemies off the Dedicated Attacker while they focus on Exolizers, but typically if extra Thrax spawn to re-possess Exolizers in the attack room, this player is expected to deal with with it so the Dedicated Attacker is not distracted.</p><h2 id="flexible-defender" tabindex="-1"><strong>Flexible Defender</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#flexible-defender" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Flexible Defender**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>his player must focus on the defence room and not leave too early. They may want to draw trash units into the golden Exolizer circles to brute force the meter down and create breathing room for the Attackers. They want to spot a Thrax coming, and kill it before it possesses an Exolizer, so the Exolizer Rotation remains intact and timers complete as quickly as possible (poor defending will slow down a run just as much as slow attacking). They want strong single-target weaponry in their loadout, and a strong Operator.</p>',8)]))}const m=t(s,[["render",i]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
