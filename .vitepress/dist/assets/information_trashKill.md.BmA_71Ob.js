Why is this important? because as mentioned before, there will be times where you need to kill trash mobs. If you have teammates who have Thrax killing covered, you&#39;re free to bring whatever crazy loadout you want to focus on trash killing. The sky&#39;s the limit.</p><h2 id="grineer" tabindex="-1"><strong>Grineer</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#grineer" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Grineer**&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Viral boosted Bleed DoTs never go wrong.</li><li>Armour strip is always a great help.</li><li>Crowd Control is always a great help, but try not to lockdown enemies away from golden Exolizer circles.</li><li>Grineer have hitscan weapons, so their accuracy is good. The Kuva Trokarians found on the Zariman tileset will also load you up with constant Bleed DoTs. These two factors combined can make shield gating builds stressful, but you will always have more breathing room in a team where aggro is shared out.</li><li>Grineer will immediately stop shooting at you if you go into stealth in front of them.</li><li>The anti-Warframe zones Trokarians (Yes the annoying dudes) created by throwing their spears can be cleared by either shooting the red glowing spear with your Amp, or Void Slinging into them.</li></ul><h2 id="corpus" tabindex="-1"><strong>Corpus</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#corpus" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Corpus**&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Pure Toxin damage will bypass shields entirely.</li><li>Bring something to deal with Nullifier bubbles, such as a weapon with a fast fire rate, or the Miter with Neutralising Justice.</li><li>Corpus tend to use projectile and beam weapons, so their accuracy is worse than Grineer. This makes shield gating builds a little less stressful.</li><li>If a Moa with a beam or Crewman with a projectile weapon is firing at you when you go into stealth, they will continue shooting at your last seen location for a couple of seconds - keep mobile.</li><li>The Derivator Crewman found on the Zariman tileset has a front-facing shield that absorbs damage, then blasts it back at you. This can leave painful Electric DoTs. The shield also body-blocks you if they&#39;re in your way in a narrow space like a doorway.</li></ul>',6)]))}const g=a(r,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
