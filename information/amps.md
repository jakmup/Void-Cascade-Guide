# Recommended Amps

This section of the guide will explain the recommended amps that are very effective in one-shotting Thrax.

## **Amp Chart**

Before explaining the optimal amps for one-shotting, here is a chart of the stats that each part of the amp give. **Chart credit:** [u/SmallCranberry9376](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/16f45rf/update_i_made_myself_an_even_nicer_amp_chart/).

## **Prisms**

The precise rifle/sniper Prisms - Raplak, Cantic, Rahn - are very effective with headshots, but these require relatively good aim/accuracy from the player. The flamethrower Klamora Prism has a large hitbox so is more forgiving, but it still requires headshots for a decent TTK at level cap.

## **Scaffolds**

The Phahd Scaffold does decent damage against Thrax Spectrals, and is notoriously good for self-reviving with Last Gasp due to the bouncing glaives providing multiple instances of damage per shot (especially effective when they get caught inside a Void bubble and repeatedly bounce on the same target). The Propa Scaffold can be timed to detonate at the end of a Thrax's Spectral animation, but its short range, inability to headshot, harsh falloff, and self knockback, can make it an inconvenient and not very effective choice.

## **Braces**

For the best possible damage output, the Certus Brace is almost mandatory due to providing the best flat critical chance. When it comes to killing Spectral Thrax in short bursts of high damage, the other Braces don't offer helpful bonuses.

## **Comparison**

A level 9999 Spectral Thrax Centurion has approximately 4,000,000 health. The damage output of various Amp parts across various Focus Schools is laid out below, to give you an idea of what your TTK will look like:
