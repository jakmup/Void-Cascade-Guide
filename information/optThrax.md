# Optimised Thrax Killing

:::info **Thrax Physical Form**

There are some high performing weapons that are well known and frequently used in the Void Cascade community for their optimal damage output:

- Laetum
- Dual Toxocyst
- Furis
- 12x Combo Melee Heavy Attacks
- Exodia Contagion Zaws

And yes, no primaries, shit is fucked.

:::

## **Laetum + Xata's Whisper**

Although the double-dipping from the Devouring Attrition evolution has been removed, Laetum has a great damage output on its own, and Xata's Whisper, being Void damage, is still a great subsume vs Void-vulnerable Thrax. This also remains an accessible option for newer players, due to the time-gated access of other Incarnon Genesis weapons in the Duviri Circuit.

## **Dual Toxocyst**

Dual Toxocyst has a great damage output, both for single target and trash clearing. It works well modded for Corrosive alongside two Corrosive Emerald Shards for armour strip, and is often paired with a Nourish subsume for Viral. Scourge is often used with it for easier headshots.

## **Furis**

Furis likewise has a great damage output, and very quickly stacks an immense amount of Heat DoTs. Roar is a good subsume for double dipping these DoTs. Scourge can help with easier headshots.

## **12x Combo Melee Heavy Attacks (Normal or Slam)**

Melee Crescendo and/or Tennokai make this method much easier to use and maintain than in the past. Wrathful Advance as a subsume can help, but is not required. Finishers for Crescendo can be easily stacked through Aero mods, Dizzying Rounds on Bronco, and Mercy kills on Eximus and heavy units.

## **Exodia Contagion Zaws**

Contagion Zaws typically rely on stacking many conditional buffs that have a multiplicative effect, such as Vigorous Swap, Arcane Arachne, and Condition Overload, but a Wrathful Advance subsume can make them more accessible with greater flexibility.

:::info **Thrax Spectral Form**

- Eternal Eradicate and Eternal Onslaught will give you the best damage output on your Amp.
- Headshots and guaranteed crits from Onslaught will make an enormous difference in your damage and TTK.
- **With Madurai:** while the Thrax performs its Spectral animation, do a Void Sling, then cast Contamination Wave three times. This primes the Thrax to take more Void damage, procs Eradicate, and depletes your energy enough to proc Onslaught.
- **With Madurai:**  Void Strike has a long cooldown, and you will often be expected to deal with Spectrals when it's not available. Get used to the Contamination Wave method above as your bread and butter, and only use Void Strike as and when needed.
- **"Parked" Warframes:** All channelled abilities and some duration abilities leave the Warframe vulnerable to 10% of incoming damage while parked. See a chart of which abilities do so here (hyperlink).
- **Amps:** Amp guidance is covered in the Amps Page (hyperlink).
