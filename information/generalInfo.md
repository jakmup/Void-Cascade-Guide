# General Mission Information

The tileset will spawn three large rooms, with connecting corridors. These large rooms - A, B, C - are where your Exolizers will spawn. This is your Exolizer Rotation. An Exolizer spawns possessed, and you must shoot/void sling the void tears with your Operator, then the central ghostly Thrax, in order to purge it. A purged Exolizer spits out a Thrax Centurion, and more Thrax will spawn regularly during the mission to re-possess purged Exolizers. (Note that only Centurions can take them back, Legatus just exist to be a nuisance.) Good or bad objective management determines mission success in Void Cascade.

## **Round Completion**

4 Exolizers complete a round. This doesn't really matter unless your doing Void Cascade as a fissure. The usual A-A-B-C mission rotation rewards are given:

- 04 Exolizers: A Reward        
- 08 Exolizers: A Reward
- 12 Exolizers: B Reward
- 16 Exolizers: C Reward

## **Exolizers Timers**

Exolizers spawn on a timer you **CANNOT** control, which means a minimum level of purging speed is required from players to keep up. However, the number of players in the team determines how many Exolizers can be active at one time.

## **Exolizers Rotation**

The Exolizer rotation is a **SEPARATE** mechanic to mission reward rotations. As explained in the beginning of the page, The tileset will spawn three large rooms with connecting corridors. These three large rooms are where your Exolizers spawn, with the rotation of A-B-C. This rotation is dictated by these three spawn rooms, where the rotation refreshes each time the Exolizer spawns fill up room C and begin again in room A.

## **Exolizer Spawns**

There are 12 distinct tileset rooms that can spawn Exolizers, with 3 to 5 spawn points depending on room. These rooms will be listed at (hyperlink).

A fresh Exolizer rotation spawns in the same order as the previous Exolizers completed. This means the Exolizer spawn order can be manipulated, whether accidentally through poor defending, or purposely to neaten up inconvenient spawns. 


## **Exolizer Gimmicks**

Each Exolizers, once purged, takes 1 minute 30 seconds to complete. You cannot speed up an Exolizer, other than ensuring it doesn't get re-possessed by a Thrax Centurion (which will pause its progress until it is purged again).

Thrax Centurions take 10 seconds to re-possess a purged Exolizer after beginning their attack. When an Exolizer is under attack, its white diamond will flash red.

Getting kills within the golden circle/dome of an Exolizer will reduce the Cascade meter. This allows you to brute force the meter down even if the number of purged Exolizers is not currently in your favour.

## **Important Extras**

- Arcane drops are automatically marked, and take 20 mins to despawn. However, Steel Essence will despawn after 5 mins.

- Once the Cascade meter fills, players are given 5 minutes to extract while their health drains. Failing to extract within the 5 minute window  will mean mission failure, and loot will be lost.

- **Enemy levels hit 1000 at 65 Exolizers.** (~30 minutes in a team, ~1 hour solo)

- **Enemy Levels hit 9999 at 107 Exolizers.** (~1 hour in a team, ~1 hour 30 minutes solo)
