# Your Priorities in This Mission

There are a lot of things to discuss regarding Void Cascade. The first thing to establish when playing the mission is that you know what your priorities are. This section will explain the priorities that you will need to know before playing the mission. This guide assummes you are running the mission in Steel Path.

## 1. Purging and Defending Exolizers

The Cascade meter is a set of scales that tips in either direction depending on how many Exolizers are currently possessed or purged. The more possessed Exolizers there are, the faster the meter will fill. A full meter means mission over (Full Red). Whatever chaos you find yourself in, consider 4+ possessed Exolizers an emergency that requires immediate attention, as the meter fills incredibly fast at this point.

## 2. Killing Thrax

Thrax drop Arcanes, so you want them dead (We love plat!). They are also dangerous elite units in their own right, with Overguard, magnetic procs, and leaping/floating attacks that make them untargetable. They're here to give you a hard time and possess Exolizers, so you dont want their numbers to spiral out of control. One Thrax always spawn after every Exolizer purge, keep no top of them so they can't repossess the Exolizer.

## 3. Culling Trash

There are times where clearing trash mobs will be your priority. Maybe they're crowding an Exolizer and you need them gone to make it safe for your Operator, maybe you desperately need energy orbs, or maybe you're getting kills within an Exolizer's golden circle to brute force the meter down. However, being a corridor warrior who gets distracted is a leading cause of runs spiralling out of control. Stay with the objective.
